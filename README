A simple shopping cart mechanism implemented via Jquery and Asp.Net. 

Initially, this plugin captures all selected items in an HTML element. Once the compare button is clicked, all items in the cart will be relayed to the identified service page. 

Below is the upfront usage:

$("#container").bucket({
	container: "container",
	compareButton: "compare-button",
	clearButton: "clear-all",
	checkBoxClass: "class-compare",
	checkBoxId: "check-compare-index",
	recordLength: 5,
	servicePage: "service.aspx",
	receiverPage: "receiver.aspx"
});

Please see Default.aspx for further info on how to implement this plugin.
